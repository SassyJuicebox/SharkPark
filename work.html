            <h2 class="paraleft">OUR HISTORY</h2>

            <p class="paraleft">Shark Park began in 1992 with three sharklovers who struggled to find reliable information on shark effects
              on thir ecoystems and changes from external factors such as climate change, overfishing, habitat loss
              and scarce food. 
              <br>
              These members became the diving chiefs you see today. After getting scuba certification after they decided the only
              information they could trust was when they gathered raw data themselves. 
              <br>
              Thirty years later, Shark Park consists of 600 people of various roles to study the migration patterns and low numbers of sharks 
              in an effort to protect them, their ecosystems and habitat as well as understand the mysteries these creatures hold.

            <h2 class="paraleft"> WHAT WE DO</h2>
            <p class="paraleft">The people at Shark Park study migration, behavioural and population changes throughout the world on the majority of shark species. 
              Donations from generous people in the community fund new equipment, software and staff to better learn about these creatures and how we 
              can prevserve them, their habitat, and reduce overfishing. 
              <br>
              By previous migration patters and rate of habitat loss, we at Shark Park can forecast future issues, including increased amount of shark 
              attacks due to food and habitat loss, and what areas sharks use as a nursery to protect as a sanctuary.

            <h2 class="paraleft">THREATS TO HABITATION</h2>
            <p class="paraleft">
              Sharks face significant threats to their habitat. One major concern is habitat loss. Coastal development and destructive fishing methods 
              like bottom trawling can lead to the destruction of crucial shark habitats. Pollution, including chemical contaminants and 
              plastics, also contributes to this issue. Climate change disrupts ocean ecosystems and affects the distribution of prey species, 
              which in turn impacts the availability of suitable shark habitats. 
              <br>
              Conservation efforts are essential to address these habitat-related threats and protect these incredible creatures. 
              By implementing sustainable fishing practices, reducing pollution, and taking action against climate change, we can help preserve 
              and restore essential shark habitats.

            <h2 class="paraleft"> SHARK NUMBERS DOWN FROM HUNTING</h2>
            <p class="paraleft">
              Sharks are facing a critical challenge when it comes to declining numbers due to hunting. The demand for shark fins, meat, 
              and other products has resulted in unsustainable fishing practices that can seriously deplete shark populations. Overfishing 
              is a significant factor leading to the decline of these magnificent creatures. Conservation efforts are paramount to combat 
              this issue and protect sharks from the devastating impact of hunting. Implementing sustainable fishing practices and stricter 
              regulations can help to curb this threat and promote the recovery of shark populations. It's vital to address this aspect of 
              shark conservation alongside habitat protection to ensure the survival of these remarkable animals.
